* Assignment 1

1. Calculate how many times this C loop will iterate. Assume that C float variables are represented using the 32 bit IEEE 754 Floating Point Standard representation.

#+begin_src C
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main() {
    int count = 0;
    float f = 1.0;
    while(f != 0.0) {
     f = f/2.0; 
     count++;
    }
    printf("Number of loops: %d", count);
  }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Number of loops: 150

2. Prove that the C shift operator <<  (>>) can be used to multiply (divide) a 32 bit unsigned int by powers of 2. Does this idea also work for 32 bit signed ints represented using 2s complement representation? If not, show a counterexample.

#+begin_src C :results verbatim
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main() {
    unsigned int u = 4;
    int sn = -4;
    int sp = 4;
    int maxp = 2147483647;
    int maxn = -2147483648;
    int maxn1 = -2147483648 + 1073741824;
    unsigned int maxu = 4294967295;

    printf("Divide by 2:\n 4(unsigned) -> %u\n 4(signed) -> %d\n -4 -> %d\n", u >> 1, sp >> 1, sn >> 1);
    printf("Divide by 8:\n 4(unsigned) -> %u\n 4(signed) -> %d\n -4 -> %d\n", u >> 3, sp >> 3, sn >> 3);
    printf("maxp: %d\n", maxp <<1);
    printf("maxn: %d\n", maxn <<1);
    printf("maxn1: %d\n", maxn1 <<1);
    printf("maxu: %u\n", maxu <<1);
  }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
Divide by 2:
 4(unsigned) -> 2
 4(signed) -> 2
 -4 -> -2
Divide by 8:
 4(unsigned) -> 0
 4(signed) -> 0
 -4 -> -1
maxp: -2
maxn: 0
maxn1: -2147483648
maxu: 4294967294
