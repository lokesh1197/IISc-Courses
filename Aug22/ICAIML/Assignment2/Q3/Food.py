        Constructor for the Food class. Takes the game
        window size as tuple for input. Has to initialize
        the following parameters.

        shape: str
               Indicates the shape of the food. Can have the
               values  “arrow”, “turtle”, “circle”, “square”,
               “triangle” and “classic”.

        color: str or tuple of RGB integers.
               Indicates the color of the food. Can have values
               "red", "green", "yellow" etc or be a tuple of
               integers like (44,99,244).

        size:  int
               Indicates the size of the food.

        window_size:
                tuple of integers
                Holds the size of the current game window

        position: tuple of integers
                  Holds the (x,y) position of the food


        You are to initialize the above variables with suitable
        values.
