* Correlated Strategy & Correlated Equilibrium
Any mixed strategy can e viewed as a correlated strategy

A Correlated Equilibrium is any correlated strategy which can be implemented self-enforcingly by a mediator who makes non-binding recommendations.

Cooperative game theory comes up with solution concepts that describe logical final outcomes of a cooperative game

** Games with contracts
Signing a contract is included as an additional strategy
Players will be willing to sign if the contracts form a NE (Guess)

IR: Individually Rational -> utility is $\geq$ maxmin, minmax

space of all IR correlated strategies $\cong$ space of all NE of contract signing games

** Games with communication
subset of games with contracts
** Setup for correlated equilibrium
Mediator announces to all players a correlated strategy (common knowledge)
Mediator picks a pure strategy profile, reveals to each player the strategy $s_i$
Player $i$ either obeys to play strategy $s_i$ or chooses any other strategy

\[ \sum_{s_{-i} \in S_{-i}} \alpha (s_i, s_{-i}) \left\{ u_i(s_i, s_{-i}) - u_i(s_i', s_{-i}) \right\} \geq 0\]
\[\forall s_i \in S_i, \forall s_i' \in S_i, \forall i \in N, \alpha (s_i) \geq 0 , \sum_{s \in S} \alpha (s_i) = 1,\]

* Nash Bargaining Solution
(F, v);  $F \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$, $v \in \mathbb{R}^2$
F -> feasible set, v -> disagreement (default) point
F -> closed, convex and bounded, non-empty

** Nash Axioms for a Solution
*** Individually Rational
Very weakly better than the default solution
*** Storng Efficiency
no other feasible solution that is strictly bettern for one player and no worse for the other player
*** Scale Co-variance
Scaling the feasible set and default point, scales the solution by the same scaling
*** Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives
If a subset of the feasible set contains the solution, then the solution for this subset is the solution of the whole feasible set
*** Symmetry
If the feasible set is symmetric and $v_1 = v_2$, then the solution will also be symmetric
** Nash Bargaining Solution
There exists unique solution satisfying the above axioms given by
\[ f(F, v) \in \mathop{\arg\max}_{(x_1, x_2) \in F, x_1 \geq v_1, x_2 \geq v_2} (x_1 - v_1)(x_2 - v_2) \]

* The Core
Transferable Utility (TU) Game

Coalitionally rational: \[ \sum_{i \in \mathcal{C}} x_i \geq v(\mathcal{C}), \forall \mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{N} \]
Individually rational: \[x_i \geq v(\{i\}), \forall i \in \mathcal{N} \], (special case of coalitionally rational)
Collectively rational: \[\sum_{i \in N} x_i = v(\mathcal{N}) \]

The core \((\mathcal{N}, v)\) is the collection of all collectively rational and coalitionally rational allocations.

Properties of a Core
1. No coalition can block any player in the core C(N, v)
2. Core allocation is stable and arises out of effective negotiations. If a core allocation is recommended, no coalition will be unhappy about it
3. C(N, v) is convex, closed and bounded
4. C(N, v) can be empty, singleton or may consist of uncountable infinite number of elements

* The Shapley Value
Axioms
1. Symmetry
2. Linearity
3. Carrier

Shapley value: 
\[ \phi_i(v) = \sum_{\mathcal{C} \subseteq N - i} \frac{|c| (n - |c| - 1)!}{n!} \left\{ v(\mathcal{C} \cup \{ i \}) - v(\mathcal{C}) \right\} \]
It is the expected marginal contribution of player $i$ to the worth of any coalition

\[ \phi_i(v) = \frac{1}{n!}\sum_{\pi \in \Pi(N)} m(\pi, i) \], \(i = 1, 2, ..., n\)
It is the expected marginal contribution of player $i$ to its predecessors with expectation taken over all permutations
